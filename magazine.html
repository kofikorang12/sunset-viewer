                <p>Quiraing is an oddly shaped landslip on the Isle of Skye Trotternish Ridge. But for all its uniqueness,
                     it offers a beautiful mountain sunset. 
                    It's a favourite spot among photographers, who come armed with their lenses. As the sun sets, 
                    the light bounces off the crags and crevices, and this light show becomes even more captivating.
                     Syke also featured in our reader survey of the most beautiful places in Scotland.
                     More accessible and equally dramatic in their own way are the Quiraing, the rock formations of the Trotternish peninsula, in the north,
                      from which there are inspirational views across to the Western Isles.</p>

                <p>Chile’s Atacama Desert is so dry that plants find it difficult to sustain life here. 
                    This is where the 2001 film Space Odyssey was shot, the desert doubling up as the Moon’s arid surface.
                     Small populations cluster round water-filled oases, witness to an incredible sunset each day. 
                     Sandboarding and sunset excursions are a popular way for tourists to enjoy the spectacle of the
                      fiery sun sinking over the bone-dry land. Explore the lunar-like landscape which will mesmerize you with its colorful geology.
                       Discover interesting rock formations composed of natural minerals,
                       including Las Tres Marías created by wind erosion over many decades.

                <p>California’s much-loved playground, Santa Monica Pier boasts rollercoasters, 
                    amusement arcades, shops and cafés. There's also a whirling carousel and an aquarium. Clearly, 
                    there's plenty of things to do; but one of Santa Monica's best experiences is totally natural.

                    When the sun begins to go down, head to the beach below the jetty.
                     Watch the lights from the amusement park twinkle in the twilight. 
                     If you've spent the day on the rollercoasters, 
                    this beautiful beach sunset will certainly keep you grounded.
