                <p> The sun setting for the day has a magnificent quality,
                     but what does a stunning sunset actually signify? For others, 
                     it's the orange hue that's descending behind an obscured structure. 
                     For others, it is observing the sweeping pink and purple hues across a scene.
                     In essence, a lovely sunset can symbolize whatever you want it to.
                     Despite the fact that we are all viewing the same sunset, 
                    we all have different perspectives on it. <br>
